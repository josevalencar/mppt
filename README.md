# Solar Panel Maximum Power Point Transfer Analysis

Interactive data visualization for solar panel experiments measuring voltage, current, and power across varying load resistances to identify the maximum power point (MPPT).

## Overview

Two experiments compare solar cell performance under different source configurations:

- **Experiment 1** -- 30 V source
- **Experiment 2** -- 29 V PSU @ 0.8 A

Each experiment plots voltage, current, and power vs. load resistance, with a comparison view showing both datasets overlaid.

## Key Result

Both experiments confirm the **Maximum Power Transfer Theorem**: peak power delivery occurs when the load resistance matches the solar panel's internal resistance (~16--20 &Omega;), regardless of illumination intensity.
